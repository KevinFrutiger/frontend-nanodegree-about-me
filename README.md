# Introduction Project #

This was the first project in the Udacity _Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree_. It was a basic one, acting simply as an introduction to the team.

## Criteria:

Starting from an existing HTML file (index.html), we edited the content and added a link to an existing CSS file (style.css). Those of us who already new CSS customized it.
